        <p>A simple and easy recipe with macaroni and cheese as the main ingredients.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow 
                macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked 
                through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.

            <li>
                At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add 
                flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes. 
                Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook 
                and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes,
                 making sure the milk doesn't burn. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.

                Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.
